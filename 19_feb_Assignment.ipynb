    "Ans 1.Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. Flask aims to keep the core of the application simple yet extensible. Flask has become popular among developers due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework, making it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Flexibility: Flask allows developers to choose the components they want to use, which makes it a flexible framework for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Modular: Flask is designed to be modular, allowing developers to add functionality as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Easy to get started: Flask has a small learning curve, and it's easy to get started with building web applications using this framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Good documentation: Flask has excellent documentation, making it easy for developers to find answers to their questions and solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Large community: Flask has a large community of developers who contribute to the framework's development, ensuring that it stays up-to-date and relevant."
