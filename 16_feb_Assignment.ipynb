    "A database is a collection of data that is stored and organized in a manner that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of that data. It is a structured way to store, manage and retrieve information. Databases are used in a variety of applications, ranging from small personal data management systems to large enterprise-level systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of databases. SQL is a relational database management system that is based on the relational model. It stores data in tables that are related to each other by keys. NoSQL, on the other hand, is a non-relational database management system that is not based on the relational model. It stores data in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented databases, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is the way they handle data. SQL databases are good for handling structured data that can be easily represented in tables. They are used for applications that require complex querying and transactions, such as banking systems. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are good for handling unstructured data, such as social media data, that cannot be easily represented in tables. They are used for applications that require high scalability and performance, such as e-commerce websites."
