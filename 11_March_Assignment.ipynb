    "\n",
    "1. **Population Standard Deviation (σ):**\n",
    "   - **t-test**: Used when the **population standard deviation is unknown** and must be estimated from the sample. The t-test is typically used when dealing with small sample sizes (usually \\( n < 30 \\)).\n",
    "   - **z-test**: Used when the **population standard deviation is known**, or the sample size is large enough (typically \\( n \\geq 30 \\)) to approximate the population standard deviation accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Size:**\n",
    "   - **t-test**: More commonly used with smaller sample sizes (less than 30). As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal (z) distribution.\n",
    "   - **z-test**: Used when the sample size is large, and the **central limit theorem** ensures that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, even if the population distribution is not normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Statistic Distribution:**\n",
    "   - **t-test**: The test statistic follows a **t-distribution**, which is similar to the normal distribution but has heavier tails. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the sample size (degrees of freedom), with larger sample sizes leading to a distribution that closely resembles a normal distribution.\n",
    "   - **z-test**: The test statistic follows the **standard normal distribution** (z-distribution), which is symmetric and has fixed properties, regardless of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applicability:**\n",
    "   - **t-test**: Best used when dealing with small samples or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",

    "  - **Test**: Since the sample size is small (n = 25), and the population standard deviation is unknown, the researcher would use a **one-sample t-test** to compare the sample mean to the population mean.\n",

    "- **Scenario**: A quality control manager wants to determine whether the average weight of bags of flour produced by a factory is different from the expected weight of 50 kg. The manager knows from historical data that the standard deviation of the weight is 2 kg, and a random sample of 200 bags is taken.\n",

    "### Given Information:\n",
    "- Sample size (\\( n \\)) = 30 participants\n",
    "- Sample mean reaction time (\\( \\bar{x} \\)) = 0.25 seconds\n",
    "- Sample standard deviation (\\( s \\)) = 0.05 seconds\n",
    "- Population mean reaction time under the null hypothesis (\\( \\mu_0 \\)) = 0.30 seconds (assumed baseline, representing the reaction time without caffeine).\n",
    "- Significance level (\\( \\alpha \\)) = 0.10 (90% confidence level)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (\\( H_0 \\))**: Caffeine has no effect on reaction time, i.e., the mean reaction time with caffeine is equal to the population mean without caffeine.\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  H_0: \\mu = 0.30\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (\\( H_1 \\))**: Caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time, i.e., the mean reaction time with caffeine is different from the population mean.\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  H_1: \\mu \\neq 0.30\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  \n",
    "This is a **two-tailed test** because we are interested in any significant difference (whether caffeine increases or decreases the reaction time).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic (t)\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the **t-statistic** for a one-sample t-test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the sample mean,\n",
    "- \\( \\mu_0 \\) is the population mean under the null hypothesis,\n",
    "- \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation,\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute the given values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "t = \\frac{0.25 - 0.30}{\\frac{0.05}{\\sqrt{30}}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "First, calculate the standard error (SE):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "SE = \\frac{0.05}{\\sqrt{30}} = \\frac{0.05}{5.477} \\approx 0.0091\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, calculate the t-statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "t = \\frac{-0.05}{0.0091} \\approx -5.49\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Determine the Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom (df) for a one-sample t-test is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Find the Critical t-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **two-tailed test** at a **90% confidence level** (which corresponds to a significance level of \\( \\alpha = 0.10 \\)), we need to find the critical t-value corresponding to \\( \\alpha/2 = 0.05 \\) in each tail, with \\( df = 29 \\). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a t-distribution table or statistical software, the **critical t-value** for \\( \\alpha = 0.10 \\) and \\( df = 29 \\) is approximately **1.699**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Compare the Test Statistic with the Critical t-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculated t-statistic** = \\( -5.49 \\)\n",
    "- **Critical t-value** = \\( \\pm 1.699 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the absolute value of the calculated t-statistic (\\( | -5.49 | = 5.49 \\)) is **greater** than the critical t-value (1.699), we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculated t-statistic is outside the range defined by the critical t-values (\\( \\pm 1.699 \\)), we **reject the null hypothesis** at the 90% confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- The data provides **strong evidence** that caffeine **significantly affects** reaction time, as the observed difference in the sample mean (0.25 seconds) and the hypothesized population mean (0.30 seconds) is statistically significant.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Thus, based on this hypothesis test, we conclude that **caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time**."
