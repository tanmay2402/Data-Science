    "1.The GET method is used to retrieve data from a particular resource on the server. It is an idempotent method, meaning it can be called multiple times without changing the state of the server.\n",
    "2.The GET method sends data in the URL query string, which is visible in the browser's address bar.\n",
    "3.This method should be used when you want to read or retrieve data from the server. For example, when fetching a page, an image, or some other resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by a specific resource on the server. It is a non-idempotent method, meaning it changes the state of the server every time it is called.\n",
    "2.The POST method sends data in the body of the HTTP request, which is not visible in the browser's address bar.\n",
    "3.This method should be used when you want to create or update data on the server. For example, when submitting a form, sending user input, or uploading a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between GET and POST methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.ata visibility: GET requests expose the data being transmitted in the URL query string, which can be seen by anyone who has access to the browser's address bar, while POST requests transmit data in the request body and thus are more secure.\n",

    "2.Caching: GET requests can be cached, while POST requests are not cacheable.\n",
