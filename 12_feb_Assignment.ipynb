    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions are typically raised when an error occurs, such as division by zero, file not found, or invalid user input.\n",

    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are errors in the syntax of the Python code, such as incorrect indentation, missing parentheses, or incorrect spelling of keywords. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter when the code is first executed and prevent the code from being executed at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, are errors that occur during the execution of the code, and the code can continue to execute even after an exception has been raised. The code can handle the exception using try-except blocks, which allow the code to continue executing even if an exception has been raised. If an exception is not handled, the code will stop executing and the error message associated with the exception will be displayed."
