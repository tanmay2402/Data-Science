    "Multithreading in Python refers to the execution of multiple threads in a single program. Each thread is an independent flow of execution, with its own call stack and state. Threads allow a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, thereby increasing the overall performance and responsiveness of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads are used to handle I/O bound and network-bound tasks, where the waiting time for the results is much longer than the time required for computation. Using threads, a program can perform other tasks while waiting for the I/O or network response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides a way to create and manipulate threads in a Python program. The threading module also provides synchronization primitives like locks, events, and semaphores to manage access to shared resources between threads."
